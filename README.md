# Weather App

## Description

This project is my first attempt to build an application using React as part of my CommandShift (aka Manchester Codes) course.

## Configurations

The project has utilized the [Airbnb style guide] (https://airbnb.io/javascript/) but the rules have been extended in the .eslintrc file to allow both .js and .jsx extensions and prop spreading.

Jest has been used for the testing library and added to the env withing .eslintrc.json.

## Usage

This project is a work in progress at present. Further updates will be outlined here.
